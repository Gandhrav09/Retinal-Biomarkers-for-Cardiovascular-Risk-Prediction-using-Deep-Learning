# Retinal-Biomarkers-for-Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
CVDs are the main reason for death worldwide and warrant early, precise, noninvasive  diagnostic approaches.Image-based retinal analysis alongside emerging advanced deep learning techniques might be a new frontier towards predicting CVDs. This review investigates the various studies that rely on retinal fundus and optical coherence tomography images besides hybrid methods that include additional modalities such as DXA scans to identify systemic vascular changes associated with CVD. This study thus illustrates that CNN-based models are capable of being applied in the non-invasive cardiovascular assessment hence forming a foundation for the development of novel approaches in the provision of health care services.
